This Python program is a machine learning application that classifies handwritten digits (0â€“9) using the scikit-learn digits dataset. It uses Logistic Regression as the classifier and evaluates model performance using a confusion matrix and classification report.

Libraries Used:
- NumPy: for array operations and normalization
- scikit-learn: for loading data, splitting datasets, training Logistic Regression, and evaluating the model
- matplotlib: for displaying images and confusion matrix

Step-by-Step Description:
1. Load the digits dataset from scikit-learn.
2. Normalize the image data by dividing pixel values by 16.
3. Ask the user how many digit images they want to preview.
4. Display those images using matplotlib.
5. Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
6. Create a Logistic Regression model and train it using the training data.
7. Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
8. Evaluate the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
