This Python program is a machine learning application that classifies handwritten digits (0â€“9) 
using the MNIST digits dataset. It uses Logistic Regression as the classifier and evaluates model
performance using a confusion matrix and a classification report.

Libraries Used:
- NumPy: for array operations and normalization
- scikit-learn: for training model Logistic Regression, Confussion Matrix and classification report
- matplotlib: for displaying images and confusion matrix
- Unpack: for loding and processing data from MNIST dataset files

Step-by-Step Description:
1. Load the training digits from the MNIST dataset located in ./Data using function the loadmnist().
2. Load the testing digits from the MNIST dataset located in ./Data using function the loadmnist().
3. Ask the user how many digit images they want to preview.
4. Normalize the image data by dividing pixel values by 16.
6. Create a Logistic Regression model and train it using the training data.
7. Testing Interface using the testModel() function
8. Evaluate the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
